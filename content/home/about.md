# Biography
I'm currently a PhD student at Stanford University, advised by Dan Schwartz. My interests center around artificial
intelligence and education, and more specifically natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and feedback
targeting.

In the past, I've been a product manager at Google and a software engineer, as well as a consultant in data science and
product management.
